# 🌱 AI Monitored Crop Health

An AI-powered web platform built with **Python Django** that helps monitor crop health using machine learning models and remote sensing techniques. The system allows farmers and researchers to analyze plant health, detect stress, and visualize insights through a user-friendly interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 **Crop Health Monitoring** – Detects crop stress using AI/ML models.
* 🖼️ **Image Analysis** – Supports processing of satellite/drone images.
* 📊 **Data Visualization** – Displays results with charts, maps, and reports.
* 🌐 **Django REST API** – Provides endpoints for integrating with frontend.
